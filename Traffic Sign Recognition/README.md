##Project 6: Traffic Sign Detection and Classification
- The pipeline used in this project is based on Convolutional Neural Network training. To run the code make sure you have certain dependencies installed:
    -  skimage
    -  tensorflow

#### Running the Code:
- The directory structure is as follows:
```
- data
- code
- output  
```
- Paste the `Training`, `Testing` and  `input` data in the `data` folder.
- The `code` folder contains the source code for the implemented pipeline. You can run it using:

```
python proj6.py
```
- The output frames will be generated in the `output` folder, which also contains an output video.
